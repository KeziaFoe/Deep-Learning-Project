Instructions
1. Dataset: Choose an image recognition dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and prepare training and test sets.
2. Network Architecture: Select a DCNN architecture (e.g., LeNet-5, VGGNet, ResNet) and explain its key components.
3. Model Implementation: Use a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to implement the DCNN architecture, including layers, activation functions, and loss function. Train the model using the training set.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the test set and calculate its accuracy. Analyze potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
5. Model Improvement: Experiment with hyperparameters, regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay), and data augmentation to enhance model performance.
6. Presentation and Discussion: Summarize the process and results in a presentation. Discuss challenges, architectural choices, and practical applications of DCNN.
